# 🧠 Deep Learning Project

This repository contains a **Deep Learning project** originally developed in Google Colab and restructured for **VS Code** and **GitHub**.
It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps using popular Deep Learning frameworks.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dl_project.git
cd dl_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Or open the notebook for experiments:

* `notebooks/Dl_project.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**

---

## 📊 Features

✔️ Data preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, augmentation)
✔️ Model building using **TensorFlow/Keras** or **PyTorch**
✔️ Training with metrics & loss visualization
✔️ Model evaluation (accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix, etc.)
✔️ Easy to extend for new datasets and models

---

## 📦 Dependencies

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* tensorflow
* keras
* torch

(Install via `requirements.txt`)

---

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Add CNN/RNN models for specific tasks
* Save & load models using `torch.save` / `model.save()`
* Deployment via Flask/Django API or Streamlit app

---
